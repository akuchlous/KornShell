KornShell:
You are sitting at a computer terminal whose 26 alphabetic keys have been randomly rearranged (permuted) and you enter your name, say, “Mike Korn.” 
Since the keys are scrambled what appears on the screen is also scrambled. 

The game consists of you typing the characters you see on the screen until your name appears. 

The length of the game is the number of times you must type a the string on the screen before your name appears, at which point the game terminates.

A game therefore consists of two pieces of information, viz., an input string and a permutation of the 26 alphabetic keys. 
Everything else is completely determined by these two pieces of information. 


The puzzle is this: if I give you a name can you give me the length of the longest possible game which uses that name as its first input?
